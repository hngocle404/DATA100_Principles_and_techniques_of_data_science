# Data 100. Principles and Techniques of Data Science

Hi this is Kelly & this repository contains my notes, homework, and lab work as I go through the UC Berkeley Data 100 course.

### What's UCB Data 100?
Data 100 builds on Data 8. I got to learn more about the maths & techniques behind data science, like statistical inference, linear models, and machine learning.
